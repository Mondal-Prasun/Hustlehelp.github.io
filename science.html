        <h3>All About BTech</h3>
        <p>BTech stands for Bachelor of Technology. It is an undergraduate four-year course and is offered in
            various disciplines and specialisations. The admissions to BTech is done on the basis of various
            national-level and state-level entrance exams and candidates are given admission on the basis of
            scores and merit list.</p>
        <h4>Why Pursue BTech</h4>
        <p>While all these specialisations offer bright prospects for students to get into different careers,
            computer science engineering is probably one of the most sought after course nowadays. This is
            also reflected in the high cut off exam scores that top engineering colleges including Indian
            Institutes of Technology (IITs), the Indian Institute of Information Technology (IIITs) and the National
            Institutes of Technology (NITs) as well as some of the best central universities command from their
            respective applicants in order to enrol them for this programme.</p>
            <h5>Who Should Pursue BTech</h5>
            <p>B.Tech degrees offer students an opportunity to pursue a career in Engineering. The courses are
                of a duration of 4-years and are spread across 8 semesters. There are typically two kinds of
                engineering programme:
                ● 3-year Lateral-Entry B.Tech after Diploma in Engineering
                ● 4-year B.Tech after Class 12
                The four-year programme offers more rigour to students and also covers more with respect to the
                depth of the curriculum.</p>
                <h6>Eligibility Criteria for BTech</h6>
                <pre>The basic eligibility requirement for admissions to any BTech programme is:
                    ● Candidates must have passed the class 12 exam from a recognised board with Physics,
                    Chemistry and Mathematics as core subjects.
                    ● They must also have secured minimum aggregate marks of 60% in the above subjects
                    combined.
                    ● Most admissions are done based on the student's performance in the entrance
                    examination.
                    ● The regular mode of entry to BTech course is through entrance examination after Class
                    12th. The other mode is called as Lateral-Entry mode, wherein candidates can enrol in
                    BTech programme in second year.
                    ● Those who possess three-year diploma programme in engineering can enroll in BTech
                    under Lateral-Entry Scheme.
                    Please note that the BTech eligibility criteria would vary from institute to institute
                    Admission Process for BTech
                    All the BTech aspirants need to follow a similar process for admission to any institute. Various
                    stages for BTech admissions are given below:
                    ● Firstly, BTech aspirants need to appear and qualify for any of the entrance exams for
                    admission to an institute.
                    ● National level engineering entrance exams such as JEE Main are accepted by NITs,
                    IIITs, GFTIs and several other private colleges. JEE Advanced is the entrance exam
                    conducted for admission to IITs.
                    ● Other than the aforesaid two exams, B Tech Admissions are also conducted through
                    state-level exams such as WBJEE, KEAM, AP EAMCET, TS EAMCET, MHT CET etc.
                    and university/college level exams such as BITSAT, VITEEE, SRMJEEE, UPESEAT,
                    etc. ● All the engineering entrance exams are conducted in April, May and June every
                    year.
                    ● After the result declaration of every exam, counselling and seat allotment process has
                    been conducted by the concerned authorities. During counselling, students have to
                    choose college and courses of their choice based on their ranks.
                    ● After seat allotment, every student needs to visit the allotted engineering college to
                    complete the admission formalities.

                    <h2>All about Bsc</h2>
                    <p>BSc or Bachelor of Science is an undergraduate degree of three years duration which is
                        universally offered across institutes and universities across India. BSc is one of the most popular
                        courses opted for by students who have a flair for scientific aptitude and zeal for research-
                        oriented and calculative approaches based on a proven systematic method. Science is all about
                        experimentation, research and discovery. A BSc degree is a culmination of both theoretical and
                        practical ways of learning. Pursuing a BSc degree also opens up multiple avenues for a student
                        and he/she can either opt for higher studies in Science or any other discipline which may be
                        related to or different from the subjects studied during graduation. However, a Master of Science
                        (MSc) is the most popular higher education alternative opted for by students after completing
                        BSc.</p>
                    <p>A B.Sc. programme can be further classified into two categories – B.Sc. Honours
                    and B.Sc. General or Pass. The former focuses on one major subject area. The
                    curriculum is designed to keep more focus on the Honours subject and also includes
                    subjects or papers from the elective subjects students opt for. The purpose of
                    studying for the B.Sc. programme is to inculcate theoretical, practical and research
                    skills among students.
                    On the other hand, the B.Sc programme provides basic knowledge of the major
                    Science subjects to the students. The curriculum is slightly lesser rigorous, but it
                    includes both theoretical and practical components.
                    The pedagogy of B.Sc. programmes is a combination of theory and practical
                    lessons. The B.Sc. curriculum includes practical lessons which carry a considerable
                    amount of weightage. To pass a semester, students need to pass both the theory as
                    well practical exams. Subjects such as Physics, Chemistry, Biology and Mathematics
                    form the core of the BSc degree. There are a plethora of specialisations and
                    branches offered in the BSc course</p>
            <h2>BSc Eligibility Criteria</h2>  
            <pre>
                ● Candidates should clear Class XII in the Science stream with a minimum of 50 per cent
to 60 per cent aggregate from a recognised board. It may be noted that the minimum
percentage required for BSc admissions may vary depending on the policy of the
university/ college to which a candidate is applying.
● Candidates must have studied (PCM) Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics or (PCB)
(Physics, Chemistry and Biolog) as core subject combinations.
● Generally, there is no age limit for pursuing a BSc unless specified by an institute's
eligibility criteria.

            <pre>● In the production and delivery of many types of medications, India has a
                particular advantage. Between April 2021 and June 2021, India shipped
                medications worth USD 5.7 billion.
                ● The sector meets more than half of the world's demand for vaccinations, 40% of
                generic drug demand in the United States, and 25% of total medicine demand in
                the United Kingdom.
                ● The value of the domestic pharmaceutical sector is USD 42 billion. The Indian
                domestic pharmaceutical market is expected to grow to USD 60 billion in 2024
                and USD 130 billion in 2030.
                ● India is the largest producer of pharmaceuticals. Working at a retail pharmacy,
                either in a health care facility or in the community, is the most obvious option
                for pharmacists.</pre>
